## Data Pipeline for Assessing BOM Weather and AIHW Hospitalization Correlation

**Data Acquisition:**

This stage ingests raw data from Google Cloud Storage buckets into BigLake tables. The BigLake tables provide a unified interface for accessing and querying data from various storage formats, including Parquet, CSV, and JSON. The specific BigLake configurations and schema definitions for the BOM weather and AIHW hospitalization data are not documented here.

**Pipeline Overview:**

The Dataform pipeline orchestrates the following high-level stages:

1. **Data Acquisition:** This stage ingests raw data from Google Cloud Storage buckets into BigLake tables.
2. **Data Transformation:** This stage cleans, transforms, and prepares both datasets for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, formatting data types, and potentially deriving new features.
3. **Data Correlation Analysis:** This stage utilizes BigQuery to perform the correlation analysis between the transformed weather and hospitalization data. The specific statistical methods employed are not documented here.
4. **Output Generation:** The results of the correlation analysis are likely stored in a BigQuery table or exported to a designated location for further exploration.

**Dependencies:**

This codebase relies on the following technologies:

* **Dataform:** A code-first approach for defining and managing data pipelines.
* **Google Cloud:** The cloud platform where the pipeline is expected to run.
* **BigQuery:** Google's data warehouse service used for data storage and analysis.
* **BigLake:** Google's unified data lake service for accessing and querying data from various storage formats.
* **SQL:** Structured Query Language used for data manipulation within BigQuery.

**Getting Started:**

This document provides a high-level overview of the pipeline.  Details regarding deployment, configuration, and specific code implementation are not covered here. Refer to the Dataform documentation and best practices for setting up and running Dataform pipelines in Google Cloud.
